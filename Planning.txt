CENTRAL COMPONENTS TO DESIGN:
- Cpu.v
- 4-to-One Mux (for Shifters)
- Pc.v (program counter)
- Reg file
- ALU - modify existing ALU
- Adder
- Control File - decode instruction into signals


ORDER OF THINGS:
1. PC accesses instruction



CPU.v
- ProgramCounter.v - only tracks actual program counter
- InstructionMemory.v (GIVEN TO US) - with PC as input, output 32-bit instruction
- Control - given an opcode, sends various signals to register file, Adder, ALU, and others in order to configure everything
